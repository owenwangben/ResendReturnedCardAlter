</div>
<div class="mb15">四、	每期分期付款應付本金、利息、手續費及其他因該筆分期交易衍生之相關費用均應計入當期信用卡帳單最低應繳款項，不得使用循環信用；若持卡人未於當期信用卡帳單繳款截止日前繳足當期信用卡帳單最低應繳金額，則仍依　貴行信用卡契約計算違約金。未清償之餘額將佔用持卡人信用卡帳戶的信用額度，且一經申辦完成後，不得變更申請金額及償還期數，完全清償前亦不得更改帳單週期。持卡人按月繳付信用卡帳款，如有溢繳情形時，該溢繳之金額將列入下期信用卡帳單抵付下期信用卡帳單之應繳款項，不會提前清償信用卡消費分期付款之金額。</div>
<div class="mb15">4.	The principal, interest, handling fee and relevant expense incurred from such installment transaction payable for each installment shall be included in the minimum amount payable for current credit billing statement, and the revolving credit may not be used therefore. If the cardholder fails to pay off the minimum amount payable for current credit card billing statement before the deadline of payment of current credit card billing statement, the default penalty shall be calculated in accordance with the credit card contract with the Bank. The outstanding balance will use the credit limit of the credit card account of the cardholder, and once the application therefore is completed, the amount and the number of installment repayment so applied may not be changed, and the billing circle may not be changed before the full liquidation thereof. The cardholder should pay the billing amounts of the credit card on a monthly basis. If there is an overpayment, the amount of overpayment will be recorded in the credit card billing statement for the next period as a credit to offset the amount payable for the credit card billing statement for the next period, and will not be used to early liquidate the amount of installment payment for credit card consumption.</div>
<div class="mb15">五、	持卡人申請各分期產品後，當期信用卡帳單如有逾期或未繳足最低應繳款項而未能清償每期應付本金時，就該帳款之餘額將列為持卡人次期信用卡帳單之前期未繳金額，並依 貴行信用卡契約之約定，以持卡人各期應付本金入帳日當時所適用之循環信用利率計收遲延期間之利息。若持卡人於分期還款期間內，有逾期繳款或其他違反信用卡契約之情事，則所有未償還之分期金額將視為全部到期，全部列入下期信用卡帳單之應繳金額，　貴行並得依第六條約定收取提前清償違約金。</div>
<div class="mb15">5.	After the cardholder has applied for respective installment products, if the current credit card billing statement has any overdue amount or underpayment of minimum amount payable, causing the principal payable for each installment cannot be liquidated, the balance of such amount will be recorded as the unpaid amount for the previous period in the credit card billing statement for the next period, and interest thereon shall be accrued for the period of delay at the revolving credit interest rate applicable to the accounting date of the principal payable for each installment of the cardholder. If the cardholder delays in payment or has other violation of the credit card contract during the period of installment repayment, all outstanding amount will be deemed due and will be recorded as the amount payable in the credit card billing statement for the next period, and the Bank may charge the default penalty for early liquidation in according with provisions of Article 6.</div>

<div class="mb15">6.	After the installment payment of credit card consumption has been applied, the Bank will, by means of short message, further inform the cardholder of such important information such as number of installments, interest rate, handling fee, and annual rate of total fees etc., and the cardholder may call the credit card service hotline of the Bank within seven (7) days from the next day of the application to cancel without bearing any expense or default penalty. After the designated time period, the cardholder may apply to early settlement of remaining amount of installment payment for credit card consumption from time to time; in such case, except for installment interest/handling fee/other fee derived therefrom that will not be returned, the remaining interest not billed will not be charged; however, the default penalty for early liquidation shall be paid. Each penalty for early liquidation is calculated at the number of remaining installments not billed x NT$30. For example, if the number of remaining installment not billed at the time application for early liquidation by the applicant is 6, then the default penalty for early liquidation of NT$180 should be paid; if the remaining number of installments is 3, then the default penalty of NT$90 shall be paid, and the amount shall gradually decrease so on.</div>
<div class="mb15">七、	信用卡消費分期付款之金額及利息/手續費/其他衍生費用無法適用　貴行現金回饋及依「紅利享樂回饋計劃」活動辦法累積紅利點數。</div>

<div class="mb15">八、	信用卡消費分期付款係由　貴行一次墊付消費款予特約商店，並由持卡人分期繳付消費帳款予　貴行。　貴行並未介入商品之交付或商品瑕疵等買賣之實體關係，相關商品退貨或服務取消之退款事宜，持卡人應先洽特約商店尋求解決，如無法解決，得要求　貴行就該筆交易以『帳款疑義之處理程序』辦理，不得因此拒付信用卡款項。</div>
<div class="mb15">8.	The amount of installment payment of consumption of credit card is advanced by the Bank to the contracted merchant in a lump sum, and is then repaid to the Bank by the cardholder by installment. The Bank is not involved in the physical transaction relation in respect of the delivery of product or defect of product.

If such matter cannot be settled, the cardholder may request the Bank to handle such matter in accordance with the “Procedures for Resolution of Disputed Billings”, but may not refuse to pay the billing amount of the credit card thereby.</div>
<div class="mb15">九、	本申請書有效期間自立約人簽署本申請書之日起一年有效，有效期間屆滿之前，經　貴行審核同意續約、且　貴行未接獲立約人通知終止本申請書，得自動續約一年，其後亦同。爾後如信用卡消費分期付款條件變更事項不劣於本條款所揭露者，則同意　貴行另行通知後適用。各產品注意事項詳見　貴行網站 bank.sinopac.com。如持卡人欲終止本申請書之約定，得隨時以電話告知　貴行。</div>
