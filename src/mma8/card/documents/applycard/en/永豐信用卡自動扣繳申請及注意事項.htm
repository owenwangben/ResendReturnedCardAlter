			4.若您以永豐銀行綜合存款帳戶設定自動轉帳扣款，扣款當日若授權之綜合存款帳戶之活存(儲)金額不足扣款時，會依您與銀行間之約定自動由定存(儲)金額或可動用貸款額度以活期領用方式轉出扣繳信用卡款，因動用到定存(儲)或貸款額度，將依銀行規定收取質借或貸款利息，若因故無法扣款者，亦不再另行補扣，屆時必須自行臨櫃或以其他方式繳納帳款。

			4.If you set up an auto debit with your Bank SinoPac's comprehensive deposit account but your demand deposit

			deduction date, the credit card payment will automatically be deducted by way of withdrawal of demand
			deposit from the fixed deposit (savings) amount or the available credit line as agreed upon between you and
			the bank. Since the fixed deposit (savings) or credit line is used, a pledge or loan interest will accrue in
			accordance with the bank's regulations. If the deduction cannot be made for some reasons, no additional
			deduction will be made and the payment must subsequently be paid at the counter or by other means.

			account in the future, please contact the bank's credit card telephone service hotline.</div>

			day prior to the payment due date or the scheduled deduction date to ensure your rights and interests. Your
			payment will be credited within one to two business days.</div>
